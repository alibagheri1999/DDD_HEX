## Description

The `myapp` directory is the root of the project. It contains the following subdirectories and files:

1. **cmd**: This directory contains the main entry point of the application, typically `main.go`.

2. **internal**: This directory contains the internal packages of the application, which are not intended for external use. It includes:
    - **adapters**: This directory contains the adapters for different external systems, such as HTTP handlers, database repositories, and message brokers.
    - **application**: This directory contains the application layer, which includes commands and queries for the application's use cases.
    - **domain**: This directory contains the domain entities and logic.
    - **ports**: This directory contains the interfaces (ports) for the application's dependencies, such as repositories, cache, broker, and services.

3. **pkg**: This directory contains reusable packages that can be shared across multiple projects.

4. **logs**: This directory contains log files, including `logstash.log` for logs sent to Logstash.

5. **config**: This directory contains configuration files, such as `config.go`.

6. **README.md**: This file is the project's README, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

The provided structure follows the Clean Architecture principles, separating the application into different layers (adapters, application, domain, and ports) to improve maintainability, testability, and flexibility.
